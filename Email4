- An intro paragraph explaining what CodePath is.
- Value props to the student include:
  > The class empowers you to build iOS apps! (check out blog.codepath.com for examples)
  > Training is used at Facebook, Airbnb, and other top Silicon Valley companies
  > Career matching opportunities if you do well in the course
- We want to bring these courses to campuses all around the world
