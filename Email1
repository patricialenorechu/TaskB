A mentor (professional engineer) has previously agreed to run a session. Send a follow-up email to the mentor confirming their participation and checking in to see if they have any questions. Tone should be friendly, excited to have them, etc.



Hi John,

Just picking up on our last conversation about running Week 6's Encryption and User Authentication session this coming August 29. We're so excited to have you onboard as a mentor! Your 7-year experience will definitely be valuable in providing context, as well as insights on industry's best practices.

Attached is a file for specific details of the venue and 

and help guide students as they collaborated on their group project apps.



Let me know if you have any questions, I'd be glad to help out any way I can!

Best,
Charlie Hieger
