A mentor (professional engineer) has previously agreed to run a session. Send a follow-up email to the mentor confirming their participation and checking in to see if they have any questions. Tone should be friendly, excited to have them, etc.

Hi John,

Just picking up on our last conversation about running Week 6's Encryption and User Authentication session this coming August 29. We're so excited to have you onboard as a mentor! Your 7-year tenure will definitely be valuable in providing context, as well as insights on industry's best practices.

Session: Encryption and User Authentication
Venue: University of Washington (Room #301)
Time: 10:00-14:00

Let me know if you have any questions, I'd be glad to help out any way I can!

All the best,
Charlie Hieger
CodePath, University Dean
