# TaskB - Drafting CodePath email templates stored on Github

This contains email templates according to the following scenarios:

1: A mentor (professional engineer) has previously agreed to run a session. Send a follow-up email to the mentor confirming their participation and checking in to see if they have any questions. Tone should be friendly, excited to have them, etc.

2: A student hasnâ€™t filled out a group survey that we use to match them with a 3 person group. Draft an email reminding them to complete it ASAP, so we can match them to a group.

3: An acceptance email to an applicant. This student has applied and has completed all necessary steps in the admissions process. This student has now been selected to participate in the course at their campus. Tone should be friendly and congratulatory.
- Reminder of why they are receiving this message (i.e they applied to our course)
- Notify the student that they have been selected to participate at their campus
- Remind them of the details of the course which meets twice a week starting on a date (make up any course logistical details to flesh out the email)
- Reply back if they have any questions

4: Cold outreach email to a university student that may be interested in enrolling in CodePath courses offered at their campus in the near future. Imagine the audience is a university student, and you want to introduce them to the class. An outline might be:
- An intro paragraph explaining what CodePath is.
- Value props to the student include:
  - The class empowers you to build iOS apps! (check out blog.codepath.com for examples)
  - Training is used at Facebook, Airbnb, and other top Silicon Valley companies
  - Career matching opportunities if you do well in the course
- We want to bring these courses to campuses all around the world
