A student hasnâ€™t filled out a group survey that we use to match them with a 3 person group. Draft an email reminding them to complete it ASAP, so we can match them to a group.

Hey there,

We have not received your response for the group survey that we sent out last week.

As you know, you will be placed in groups of 3 for your course project and we will be using the survey responses to effectively match students up based on skill, fields of interest and other factors. 

Kindly complete with the survey within 24 hours as we are finalizing the groupings in the next two days. Thank you.

All the best,
Charlie Hieger
